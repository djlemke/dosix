DOSIX is a 16-bit compatible set of Unix tools that runs on FreeDOS. Eventually, this project will be used to create a simple Unix-like FreeDOS system that can run on low-end hardware, such as old PCs or SBCs.

Goals:
- 16-bit compatible
- Fits on one floppy disk with FreeDOS kernel
- Mostly POSIX compliant
- Doesn't modify FreeDOS kernel

Why:
- I have muscle memory for Unix commands
- I thought it would be neat to build a single-user Unix-like system on top of FreeDOS
